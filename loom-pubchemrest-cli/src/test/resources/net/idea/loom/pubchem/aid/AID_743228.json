            "Various chemicals, environmental and physiological stress conditions may lead to the activation of heat shock response/ unfolded protein response (HSR/UPR). There are three heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) (HSF-1, -2, and -4) mediating transcriptional regulation of the human HSR. To identify the compounds that activate HSR signaling, HSE-bla HeLa cell line (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of the heat shock response elements was used to screen the Tox21 10K compound library. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the HSE-bla cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega, Madison, WI) in the same wells. The compounds were also tested for auto fluorescence that may interfere with the biological target readout resulting in potential false positives and/or negatives."

Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
