            "p53, a tumor suppressor protein, is activated following cellular insult, including DNA damage and other cellular stresses.  The activation of p53 regulates cell fate by inducing DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or cellular senescence.  The activation of p53, therefore, is a good indicator of DNA damage and other cellular stresses.  The CellSensor p53RE-bla HCT-116 cell line (Invitrogen) contains a stably integrated beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under control of the p53 response elements.  The activation of the reporter gene under culture conditions can be detected by fluorescence intensity.  This cell line was used to screen the Tox21 compound library in a 1536-well plate format and to identify agonists that activate the p53 signaling pathway. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the p53 RE-bla HCT-116 cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the intra cellular ATP content in the same wells."
