            "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are lipid-activated transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily with three distinct subtypes namely PPAR alpha, PPAR delta (also called PPAR beta) and PPAR gamma (PPARg). All these subtypes heterodimerize with Retinoid X receptor (RXR) and these heterodimers regulate transcription of various genes. PPAR-gamma receptor (glitazone receptor) is involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. To identify the compounds that activate PPAR-gamma signaling, GeneBLAzer PPAR gamma UAS-bla HEK293H cell line (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of an Upstream Activator Sequence (UAS) was used to screen the Tox21 compound library. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the PPARg-bla cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay in the same wells."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score.
