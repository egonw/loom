            "Estrogen receptor (ER), a nuclear hormone receptor, plays an important role in development, metabolic homeostasis and reproduction. Two subtypes of ER, ER-alpha and ER-beta have similar expression patterns with some uniqueness in both types. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their interactions with steroid hormone receptors like ER causes disruption of normal endocrine function. To identify the compounds that inhibit ER-alpha signaling, an ER-alpha-UAS-bla GripTiteTM cell line (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of an Upstream Activator Sequence (UAS) stably integrated into HEK293 cells was used to screen the Tox21 10K compound library. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the ERalpha-bla cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay in the same wells."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score.
