            "Estrogen receptor (ER), a nuclear hormone receptor, plays an important role in development, metabolic homeostasis and reproduction. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their interactions with steroid hormone receptors like ER causes disruption of normal endocrine function. Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of environmental chemicals on the ER signaling pathway. To identify ER antagonists, BG1-Luc-4E2 cell line (provided by Dr. Michael Denison from University of California) has been used to screen the Tox21 10K compound library. BG1Luc4E2 cell line endogenously expresses full-length ER-alpha and is stably transfected with a plasmid containing four estrogen responsive elements (ERE) upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the BG1-Luc-4E2 cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Fluor assay (Promega, Madison, WI) in the same wells."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
