            "Androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear hormone receptor, plays a critical role in AR-dependent prostate cancer and other androgen related diseases. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their interactions with steroid hormone receptors like AR may cause disruption of normal endocrine function as well as interfere with metabolic homeostasis, reproduction, developmental and behavioral functions. To identify the compounds that inhibit AR signaling, MDA-kb2 AR-luc cell line (from ATCC, deposited by Wilson et al.) was used to screen the Tox21 10K compound library. MDA-kb2 AR-luc cell line is human breast carcinoma cell line that was stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under control of the MMTV promoter containing response elements for both androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the MDA-kb2 AR-luc cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Fluor assay (Promega, Madison, WI) in the same wells."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
