            "The farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR), a nuclear hormone receptor, is highly expressed in liver, intestine, kidney and adrenal cortex. Natural ligands of FXR are the bile acids (Cholic acid, Chenodeoxy cholic acid etc). FXR is an important regulator of diverse metabolic pathways, including the bile acid homeostasis, lipid and glucose metabolisms. FXR regulates the expression of target genes by binding either as a monomer or as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Numerous studies have reported that FXR exerts protective function during cholestasis, diabetes, liver regeneration, and cancer. To identify compounds that inhibit FXR signaling, GeneBLAzer FXR-UAS-bla HEK 293T cell line (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element was used to screen the Tox21 10K compound library. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the FXR-bla cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay in the same wells."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
