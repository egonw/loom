Total intracellular ATP content corresponds to the number of metabolically competent cells after compound treatment. The cells were dispensed at 2,000 cells/5 uL/well in 1,536-well white/solid bottom assay plates using a Flying Reagent Dispenser (Aurora Discovery, San Diego, CA). The cells were incubated a minimum of 5 h at 37 C, followed by the addition of 23 nL of compounds dissolved in DMSO, positive controls or DMSO only using a pintool work station (Kalypsys, San Diego, CA).  The assay plates were incubated for 18 h at 37 C, followed by the addition of 5 uL/well of CellTiter-Glo reagent. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, the luminescence intensity of the plates was measured using a ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT)."
