            "The Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is one of the members of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors.  GR plays a critical role in carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolisms and programmed cell death. CellSensor GR-bla HeLa cell line (Invitrogen) contains a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of the glucocorticoid response element stably integrated into HeLa cells, a cervical cancer cell line that expresses glucocorticoid receptor.  The activation of the reporter gene under culture conditions can be detected by fluorescence intensity. This cell line has been used to screen the Tox21 10K compound library and to identify the compounds that inhibit the GR signaling.  The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 10K compound library against the GR-bla HeLa cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay in the same wells."
