            "Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), one of the parameters for mitochondrial function, is generated by mitochondrial electron transport chain that creates an electrochemical gradient by a series of redox reactions. This gradient drives the synthesis of ATP, a crucial molecule for various cellular processes. Measuring MMP in living cells is commonly used to assess the effect of chemicals on mitochondrial function; decreases in MMP can be detected using lipophilic cationic fluorescent dyes.",

            "A homogenous cell-based assay with a water soluble mitochondrial membrane potential sensor (m-MPI, Codex Biosolutions, MD) was used to evaluate chemically induced mitochondrial toxicity. The dye accumulates in the mitochondria of healthy cells as aggregates, with red fluorescence. The mitochondrial potential decreases and the dye could not accumulate in the mitochondria and remains in the cytoplasm in monomers, with green fluorescence. In addition to the mitochondrial potential assay, these cells were also used to test the cytotoxicity by determining the cell viability  in the culture based on the quantitation of ATP present. The cytotoxicity was measured in the same assay well of MMP assay."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
