            "The Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is one of the members of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors.  GR plays a critical role in carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolisms and programmed cell death. CellSensor GR-bla HeLa cell line (Invitrogen) contains a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of an upstream activator sequence (UAS) stably integrated into HeLa cells, a cervical cancer cell line that expresses glucocorticoid receptor.  The activation of the reporter gene under culture conditions can be detected by fluorescence intensity. This cell line has been used to screen the Tox21 10K compound library and to identify the compounds that activate the GR signaling. The compounds were also tested for auto fluorescence that may interfere with the biological target readout resulting in potential false positives and/or negatives."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
