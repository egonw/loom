            "Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. The antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway plays an important role in the amelioration of oxidative stress. The CellSensor ARE-bla HepG2 cell line (Invitrogen) can be used for analyzing the Nrf2/antioxidant response signaling pathway. Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) and Nrf1 are transcription factors that bind to AREs and activate these genes. The CellSensor ARE-bla Hep G2 cell line contains a beta-lactamase reporter gene under control of the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) stably integrated into HepG2 cells. The activation of the report gene under culture conditions can be detected by fluorescence intensity. This cell line has been used to screen the Tox21 10K compound library to identify agonists that induce oxidative stress. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the ARE-bla cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega, Madison, WI) in the same wells. The compounds were also tested for auto fluorescence that may interfere with the biological target readout resulting in potential false positives and/or negatives."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
