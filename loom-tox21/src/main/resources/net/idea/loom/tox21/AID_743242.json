            "The vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, plays a critical role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. It is also involved in cell differentiation and growth, and thrombogenicity. To identify the compounds that inhibit VDR signaling, the VDR-UAS-bla HEK 293T cell line (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of an upstream activator sequence (UAS) was used to screen the Tox21 10K compound library. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the VDR-bla cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay in the same wells."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
