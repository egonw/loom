            "Thyroid receptor (TR), a nuclear hormone receptor, plays an important role in development, proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, brain function, and cardiovascular system. TR-interacting compounds have been shown to disrupt thyroid homeostasis. To profile the Tox21 10K compound library in TR signaling, a cell-based GH3-TRE-Luc assay (GH3.TRE-Luc cell line, developed by the laboratory of Dr. Albertinka J. Murk, Wageningen University) was used to measure the inhibition of TR. GH3 (rat pituitary tumor) cells stably expressing a TR activity sensor consisting of two TR response elements and a luciferase reporter gene. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the GH3.TRE-Luc cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Fluor assay (Promega, Madison, WI) in the same wells."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
