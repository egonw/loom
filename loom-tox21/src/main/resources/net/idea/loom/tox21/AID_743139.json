            "Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with the biosynthesis and normal functions of steroid hormones including estrogen and androgen in the body. Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of androgen to estrogen and plays a key role in maintaining the androgen and estrogen balance in many of the EDC-sensitive organs. MCF-7 aro ERE cell line (provided by Dr. Shiuan Chen at Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope) was used to screen the Tox21 10K compound library collection for identification of aromatase inhibitors. MCF-7 aro ERE is human breast carcinoma cell line that was stably transfected with a promoter plasmid, pGL3-Luc, containing three repeats of estrogen responsive element (ERE). The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the MCF-7 aro ERE cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Fluor assay (Promega, Madison, WI) in the same wells."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
