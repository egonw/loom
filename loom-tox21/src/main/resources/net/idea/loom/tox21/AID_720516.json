Based on this concept, many chemotherapeutic agents were developed but have limitations such as low efficacy and severe side effects etc. A new cell based assay was developed to find the compounds that effectively block DNA replication either by directly damaging DNA or by inhibiting other cellular mechanisms.",

Using a luciferase reporter-gene tagged with ATAD5, a cell-based assay [developed by Kyungjae Myung, NHGRI, NIH] was used to measure the induction of ATAD5 in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). So, increase in luciferase activity can be used to identify the compounds that cause genetic stress. In addition to genotoxicity, these cells were also used to test for cytotoxicity by measuring the protease activity within live cells."

For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype.",
